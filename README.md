# observ-users

This is a simple observable data structure (an
[`observ-varhash`](https://github.com/nrw/observ-varhash)) that can be used
to report on the names of the participants connected to a room when working
with [`rtc-quickconnect`](https://github.com/rtc-io/rtc-quickconnect).

It does  require that people provide a `uid` and `name` attribute as part of
their quickconnect profile information, and once they have they will be
reported as part of this list.
